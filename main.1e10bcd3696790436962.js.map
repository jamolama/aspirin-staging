As a brief summary, the updated app recommends limited use of aspirin in primary prevention of ASCVD, with candidates meeting the following criteria: 1) Ages 40-59 with 10-year ASCVD risk score ≥ 10%; 2) Ages 60-69 with 10-year ASCVD risk score ≥ 20% or with diabetes and risk score ≥ 10%; 3) no excess bleeding risk; 4) estimation of benefit:risk ratio, based on ASCVD risk score vs bleeding risk score, is favorable (the app’s calculation of number needed to treat [NNT] is less than number needed to harm [NNH]); and 5) Patient is receptive to aspirin based on shared decision making.\\n\\nA web-based version of Aspirin-Guide is available at www.aspiringuide.com and is accessible from any computer or smartphone.

As a brief summary, the updated app recommends limited use of aspirin in primary prevention of ASCVD, with candidates meeting the following criteria: 1) Ages 40-59 with 10-year ASCVD risk score \\u2265 10%; 2) Ages 60-69 with 10-year ASCVD risk score \\u2265 20% or with diabetes and risk score \\u2265 10%; 3) no excess bleeding risk; 4) estimation of benefit:risk ratio, based on ASCVD risk score vs bleeding risk score, is favorable (the app\\u2019s calculation of number needed to treat [NNT] is less than number needed to harm [NNH]); and 5) Patient is receptive to aspirin based on shared decision making.\\n\\nA web-based version of Aspirin-Guide is available at www.aspiringuide.com and is accessible from any computer or smartphone.
