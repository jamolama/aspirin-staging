Published 2021.\\n    d) Evidence Synthesis Report by AHRQ for the USPSTF statement on aspirin (Guirguis-Blake JM, et al.  (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/document/draft-evidence-review/aspirin-use-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-preventive-medication)\\n    e) The American Diabetes Association’s (ADA’s) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2022 (Diabetes Care 2022;45(Suppl. 1):S144–S174 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc22-S010)\\n\\nBased on the above references (a-e) and using information about the patient's risk factors, the Aspirin-Guide app calculates a 10-yr ASCVD risk score (the ACC/AHA ASCVD score (a) and a bleeding risk score on aspirin therapy (based on published studies and the 2016 and 2022 USPSTF evidence synthesis) for bleeding risk assessment for the patient [d f, g), and provides guidance for balancing the benefits and risks.  As a brief summary, the updated app recommends limited use of aspirin in primary prevention of ASCVD, with candidates meeting the following criteria: 1) Ages 40-59 with 10-year ASCVD risk score ≥ 10%; 2) Ages 60-69 with 10-year ASCVD risk score ≥ 20% or with diabetes and risk score ≥ 10%; 3) no excess bleeding risk; 4) estimation of benefit:risk ratio, based on ASCVD risk score vs bleeding risk score, is favorable (the app’s calculation of number needed to treat [NNT] is less than number needed to harm [NNH]); and 5) Patient is receptive to aspirin based on shared decision making.\\n\\nA web-based version of Aspirin-Guide is available at www.aspiringuide.com and is accessible from any computer or smartphone. Aspirin-Guide is also available on iOS devices, allowing emailing of recommendations to the patient.

As a brief summary, the updated app recommends limited use of aspirin in primary prevention of ASCVD, with candidates meeting the following criteria: 1) Ages 40-59 with 10-year ASCVD risk score \\u2265 10%; 2) Ages 60-69 with 10-year ASCVD risk score \\u2265 20% or with diabetes and risk score \\u2265 10%; 3) no excess bleeding risk; 4) estimation of benefit:risk ratio, based on ASCVD risk score vs bleeding risk score, is favorable (the app\\u2019s calculation of number needed to treat [NNT] is less than number needed to harm [NNH]); and 5) Patient is receptive to aspirin based on shared decision making.\\n\\nA web-based version of Aspirin-Guide is available at www.aspiringuide.com and is accessible from any computer or smartphone.
